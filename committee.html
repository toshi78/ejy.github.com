				Hi, I’m Louise, president of Medsin. Medsin is a great charity to get involved in because we do a bit of everything – we get involved with lots of other charities (like Teddy Bear Hospital, Sexpressions and many more) and we do our own thing (like campaigning for Student Stop AIDS, work with Health Poverty Action, hosting lectures from world-famous speakers and reacting to global health crises). So if you’re keen to make a difference and want an exciting project to get involved in, contact <a href="mailto:medsoc-charities@contacts.bham.ac.uk">Medsin</a>.

				Hello, I’m Phil and I’m Medsin’s Secretary. I have been in this role for two years now and have really enjoyed taking part in the development of this exciting charity and documenting everything Medsin has achieved. One of the highlights for me was one of our Global Health Lectures last year when Jonathan Glennie from UCL gave an outstanding talk called ‘The Trouble with Aid’ to a full lecture theatre.  Also I like how Medsin benefits from being an ‘umbrella charity’ for all other charities in the medical school. Thanks to this, we have the potential to work with each of the charities and there is lots of opportunity to bring all our different campaigns together.

				Hi, I'm Elliot, Website Rep for Medsin Birmingham. I am new to this role though have been responsible for the creation of Medsin's new website ahead of the 2011/2012 year. The website is very much a work in progress and I welcome any feedback on the project. In the coming months, I am hoping to implement full e-signup, better Facebook integration, a frequently updated activity calendar and more. I am excited by the work Medsin does and look forward to my first year as Website rep!
