				<ol>
					<li><b>End poverty and hunger</b><br />
						Medsin react to current afairs. At the moment we are launching 2 campaigns to raise money for the food and water shortages in East Africa. We also work with Health, Poverty, Action, a global charity, dedicated to imroving the lives of those in developing countries.<br /><br />
					</li>
					<li><b>Universal education</b><br />
						Medsin's vision statement says how we believe it's the right of every human to have the chance to care. We believe in educating people about global health issues, to give them the chance to do something to change the world, locally, or abroad. See our Global Health Lecture Series.<br /><br />
					</li>
					<li><b>Gender equality</b><br />
						Sexpression run regular educational and campaign evenings on bringing an end to female genital mutilation.<br /><br />
					</li>
					<li><b>Child health</b><br />
						Teddy Bear Hospital helps young children interact with health care professionals and aims to make them more accessible, meaning being ill isn't so scary.<br /><br />
					</li>
					<li><b>Maternal health</b><br />
						Medsin supports the Rainbow Trust, who provide support to parents whose child has a life threatening or terminal illness. This charity really is a lifeline to these families and stay with them from onset, during the illness and after the child's death.<br /><br />
					</li>
					<li><b>Combat HIV/AIDS</b><br />
						Medsin works closely with the Student Stop AIDS campaign to raise awareness of this disease. We also lobby politicians and drugs companies in their name, to achieve pharmaceutical justice for those who are otherwise priced out of the drugs market and effectively left to die.<br /><br />
					</li>
					<li><b>Environmental sustainability</b><br />
						As part of our education programme, Medsin organise lectures on the effects and prevention climate change both at home and abroad.<br /><br />
					</li>
					<li><b>Global partnership</b><br />
						We believe that health is a global issue; not something to be tackled by a handful of nations. Its promotion needs to be addressed by the whole world, for the whole world.<br /><br />
